description:
Given an list of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that
they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one two_sum, and you may not
use the same element twice.

Example:

Given arr = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because arr[0] + arr[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

    for i in range(0, len(arr)):

        complement = target - num
        # if the complement is not present in lookup then
        # insert the number as key, index as value
